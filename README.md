# Customer-Visit-Data-Processing-and-Validation-System
## Overview
In customer relationship management, maintaining accurate and consistent data is critical for ensuring smooth operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and enabling data-driven decision-making. This project addresses the challenges associated with managing new customer data by providing a Python-based system for data validation, cleaning, and integration into a master dataset.
## Business Problem
Customer data, collected manually or through multiple channels, is often prone to errors such as duplication, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. These data issues can lead to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and lost business opportunities. Additionally, businesses often lack automated systems to process and validate customer information in a scalable and efficient manner.
## Key Challenges:
1. Data Quality Issues: Inconsistent formats, missing fields, and duplicate records make data unreliable.
2. Manual Processing: Handling customer information manually is time-consuming and error-prone.
3. Scalability: The need to process up to 200 customer records at a time requires a robust system that can handle large datasets.
4. Geo-Coordinates Collection: Automatically capturing the geographical location of customers submitting forms through an app is essential to ensure completeness and accuracy.
## Solution
The Customer Data Processing and Validation System is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the validation, cleaning, and merging of customer data into a master dataset. It addresses the aforementioned challenges by automating the following tasks:
1. Data Validation:
   - Identifies and handles missing fields.
   - Ensures data consistency (e.g., standardizing date formats, and validating email addresses).
   - Removes duplicate records by comparing customer attributes (e.g., name, phone number).

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Converts fields to appropriate data types (e.g., strings, dates).
   - Standardize address and phone number formats for consistency.
3. Geo-Coordinates Integration:
   - Automatically captures and associates geo-coordinates from app-submitted forms to enrich customer data.
4. Scalable Processing:
   - Handles up to 200 customer records at a time, ensuring smooth and efficient operation for bulk data. Handles up to 200 customer records at a time, ensuring smooth and efficient operation for bulk data.
5. Integration with Master Dataset:
   - Validates and transfers processed data to the master dataset only after customers complete their first interaction.
## Skills Showcased
- Data Cleaning and Validation: Expertise in ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
